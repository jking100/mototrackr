#### Log and share stats from your rides

The goal of this site is to create a social space where users will be able to track and log their rides, practice sessions, and other metrics related to motorcycling.
This data will be presented back to the user in an actionable way to provide insights to aid their training.
Finally, users will be able to share this data to the site publicly, with the hope of fostering a community based around technical motorcycling.

#### About

This repo contains a progressive web app written using JavaScript and React. The app makes heavy use of device sensors and gps to capture and calculate various metrics on a time interval along the userâ€™s ride.

As of v00.01 users are currently able to track their:

- Max Lean angle +/-
- Ride Time
- With plans for much more (route visuals, speed, max G's accel/decel, etc...)


#### Upcoming Features

What I am currently working on, in no order:
 - Public ride data sharing - allow users to submit their rides, save and display these on the site if the user wants
 - Ride Map Visual - Overhead map image showing the users ride with coloring based on lean/speed etc..., designed to be highly sharable on mobile
 - Avg/Max speed recording
 - Max G acceleration and deceleration
 - Improved UI and app experience
